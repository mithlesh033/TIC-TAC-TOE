# TIC-TAC-TOE
Tic-tac-toe, also known as noughts and crosses, is a classic two-player game where the objective is to be the first to get three of one’s own marks in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The game is played on a three-by-three grid. Players take turns placing their mark (an ‘X’ or an ‘O’) in an empty square.
